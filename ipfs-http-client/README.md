ipfs-http-client


> A client library for the IPFS HTTP API, implemented in JavaScript. This client library implements the IPFS [Core API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs/api) enabling applications to change between an embedded js-ipfs node and any remote IPFS node without having to change the code. In addition, this client library implements a set of utility functions.

```bash
npm install --save ipfs-http-client
```

Both the Current and Active LTS versions of Node.js are supported. Please see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) for what these currently are.
